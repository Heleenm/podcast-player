This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

Run `npm install` to get all the packages, then `npm start` to run the app in development mode.
Open http://localhost:3000 to view it in the browser.


The project relies on the server provided with the assigment.

#### personal notes
Most of my time was spent on showing the markers and the functionality of the scrub bar. 
I haven't spent any time on showing the markers for the duration specified or any of the optional features.

If I had more time I would: finish the assignment; refactor code; make sure the player is accessible; and add some better styling.
